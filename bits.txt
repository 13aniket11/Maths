Bits i.e 0 and 1

binary representaion of any numbers have 0s and 1s...

we have several representaions format on the basis of its base. example 10 base known as "decimal", 2 base known as "binary" etc.

Lets understand by Example

if 5 is a decimal number with base 10.
so this decimal 5 is equivalent to binary 101.

lets know in depth.

In genral we use Decimal format who has 10 base, but we didn't always mention about it.

as dec means 10.

similarly,
bin means 2
oct means 8
hexdec means 16

so this were the other commonly known representaion formats.



Now lets understand how can we convert one format to other.
1. dec to bin

algorithm-

n=5;
string s = "";
while(n>0)
{
s+=n%2;
	n/=2;
}
reverse(s);

others are under construction

we will work on next time

now lets play with bits

1. left shift

suppose we have 10101
after left shift

10101 -> 101010
21	 42
---------------------------eq1

suppose we have 111
after left shift

111 -> 1110
7      14
---------------------------eq2

from eq1 and eq2

it is proven that after left shift number gets doubled.

in formal if number is in binary then it gets doubled if its in decimal then it becomes 10 times and so on...

so final conclusion is after left shift numbers get multiplied by its base.(2,8 or 10 etc)


2. right shift.
